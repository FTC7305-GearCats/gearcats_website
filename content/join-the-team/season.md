# Season Structure

The FTC Season begins with the Kick-off and Game Reveal where the team
gathers to play a few ice-breakers before we learn the new FTC game
and begin to strategize its important aspects. We then enter the Build
Season, where we hold regular meetings where we design (and redesign),
build (and rebuild), wire (and rewire), program (and reprogram),
troubleshoot, and practice with the robot. During the Build Season,
students create an Engineering Notebook that illustrates the robot's
design, programming, electronics and evolving concepts.

Right before the end of Build Season, GearCats attend a Scrimmage (or
mock-competition). Scrimmages are great opportunities to see how the
robot might perform when playing the game with other robots in a low
stress environment. They give students a chance to make changes, get
driving practice, and repair the robot.

Once the Build Season comes to an end, we enter Competition Season,
where the GearCats robot competes head-to-head against other teams'
robots. GearCats students can drive the robot in matches, service it
in the Pits, and take detailed notes on competing robots. GearCats
compete at the Regional level, and if we do well enough, we can
advance to the State competition, or World championship.
