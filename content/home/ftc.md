FTC introduces middle schoolers to FIRST robotics. The GearCats are
FTC Team 7305. Students build robots that fit within an 18 inch
cube. GearCats students can learn how to design, construct, wire, and
program their robot, depending on what interests them. They also can
learn how to create their own custom parts out of metal sheet,
extrusions, or blocks. The robot program is written in Java, a
powerful programming language.
