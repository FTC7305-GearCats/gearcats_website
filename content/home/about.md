Middle school students gain education in STEM fields (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) from high school student
mentors eager to share and grow their knowledge. As Gearcat students,
we strategize, design, build, program, troubleshoot, and compete with
the team robot for a chance at winning the national
championship. Students come together as a team to put their best foot
forward when building and competing. Emphasizing gracious
professionalism, teams compete fairly with one another and support
opposing teams to perform at their best.
