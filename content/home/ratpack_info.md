The GearCats are sponsored and mentored by FIRST Robotics Competition
[Team 830 The RatPack](http://www.ratpackrobotics.com/), a high school
robotics team with members from six area high schools.

We strive to create a symbiotic relationship through student
mentorship. Middle schoolers gain confidence and knowledge by learning
from their high school counterparts. High school mentors gain valuable
leadership and communication experience from guiding the middle school
students. The end result is an empowering investment in both student
groups.
