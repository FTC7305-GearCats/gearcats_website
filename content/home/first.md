FIRST is an international organization that engages students from
elementary school to high school in competitive robotics. Every year,
FIRST develops a new game for each major age group. Games are designed
for robots to play. Students custom design their robot every year to
play the new game. Each team's robot must be ready to compete when the
deadline arrives, and no more work can be done on the robot until
competition. Teams compete with their robots at the regional level for
a chance at the state competition, and again for the world
championship. Each match of the game is made of two alliances, red and
blue. Each alliance is made up of two randomly selected robots. A
robot on your alliance this match could become an opponent in the
next. FIRST encourages Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition,
where students and teams compete their hardest, yet are respectful to
opponents and partners.
